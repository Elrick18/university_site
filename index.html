            June 1891. On the slope of Mount Royal, just steps from McGill
            University’s main campus,<br />
            construction began on an important site of healing, helping, and
            educating: the Royal<br />
            Victoria Hospital.

          <p class="text1">
            From the very beginning, a close bond would unite the Royal Vic and
            McGill. The hospital’s mission: to heal people without<br />
            discrimination based on creed or ethnicity. The mission of McGill’s
            Faculty of Medicine: pioneering new ways of healing<br />
            and forging new paths in medical research and education. What would
            follow is more than a century of collaboration in<br />
            service to society.
          </p>
          <p class="text2">
            Over 130 years later, the landscape is changed and the vast complex
            of the Royal Vic has been vacant since 2015. An idea is <br />born…
            to revitalize this historic site.
          </p>
          <p class="text3">
            Today, this idea is being brought to life. Under the guidance and in
            collaboration with government authorities, McGill University is<br />
            developing a proposal to reimagine a portion of the former hospital
            site as a state-of-the-art research, teaching, and learning hub<br />
            dedicated to Sustainability Systems and Public Policy.
          </p>
          <p class="text4">
            In line with the Royal Victoria Hospital’s original vocation as a
            place of healing, the New Vic Project aims to help heal the planet,
            by<br />
            tackling the greatest challenges that threaten it.

            McGill’s Strategic Academic Plan states that no<br />
            university can lead globally in the 21st century <br />without
            putting sustainability at the centre of its<br />
            operations, research, and teaching.
          </p>
          <p class="about2">
            This is our commitment, as the New Vic Project helps <br />us
            redefine what an open, connected, and purposeful<br />
            university can be.
